# Pee

The Pee programming language.

- C like
- PHP inspired


## Goals

We'll write a parser, then an interpreter, and finally a compiler. We'll start with another language but eventually Pee will be self-hosting, meaning that it is written in itself. The functions we use to write the parser, then, will be good candidates to be created first.

Pee is a simple language with a minimal set of functions but the hope is that it will eventually include a robust standard library.

Pee is inspired by PHP and C but is not compatible with any of them. There is no goal to run a PHP program or a C program.


## Questions

Lots of PHP functions have two different versions. Such as echo/print and die/exit as well as aliases. Do we want to pick one or allow alias?


## Roadmap

List of functions to write (my personal preference listed first where two commands are very similar).

- print/echo
- exit/die
- include/require
